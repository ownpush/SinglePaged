## Push messages are a key tool
<div align="center">Developers know that in order to keep their users engaged with their apps/services they need to use push messages. Until now there has been little choice outside of Google Cloud Messaging (GCM). With this lack of choice came a dependency on Google Services which is a known battery and resource drain on todayâ€™s modern devices. This dependency also has created a challenge for developers looking to provide the billion or more users who do not have access to Google Services, or choose to value privacy, with push notifications.</div>
